# Technical Specification

## About

This documentation describes the APDU messages interface to communicate with the QRL v2.0 application.

The application covers the following functionalities :

- Get a public QRL v2.0 address given a BIP 32 path
- Sign a QRL v2.0 transaction given a BIP 32 path and RLP encoded transaction data
- Retrieve the QRL v2.0 app version
- Retrieve the QRL v2.0 app name

The application interface can be accessed over HID or BLE

## APDUs

### GET QRL v2.0 PUBLIC ADDRESS

#### Description

This command returns the public QRL v2.0 address for the given BIP 32 path.

The address can be verified on the device before being returned.

### SIGN QRL v2.0 TRANSACTION

#### Description

This command signs a QRL v2.0 transaction after having the user validate the transactions parameters.

The input data is the RLP encoded transaction streamed to the device in 255 bytes maximum data chunks.

As the signature size exceeds maximum APDU response length, responses will be chunked with max size of 258 bytes each. The main app should request each chunk manually with index from 0-17, where the first chunk will be automatically returned after the last transaction data is sent and the signature is computed.
